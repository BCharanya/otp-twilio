OTP-Based User Authentication System with Twilio Integration

This Python application is a GUI-based OTP verification system built with Tkinter and integrated with the Twilio API to send OTPs to a user's mobile number. The user inputs the OTP received on their phone to complete verification.

**Features:**

**OTP Generation and Sending:** Generates a random 4-digit OTP and sends it to the user’s phone number using Twilio.

**OTP Verification:** Checks the user’s OTP input and verifies it against the generated OTP.

**OTP Resend:** Provides the option to resend the OTP if the user does not receive or needs another attempt.
